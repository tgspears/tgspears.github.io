		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi there! I'm Trevor and I am a Full Stack Web Developer! This is a fairly new development, I've been learning Web Development for around 5 months. In that time I attended General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in which I worked for 12 weeks (and around 10-12 hours a day) learning absolutely as much as I could to prepare myself for the WebDev industry.</p>
		<p>Some of the skills I learned during that time are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>  Build sites from the ground up using both Javascript and Ruby in the form of ground-up development as well as using frameworks such as Rails and Sails.
			<li>  Create and manage Mongo and Postgres databases
			<li>  Build APIs in Rails and ExpressJS
			<li>  Create modern and interactive Front-End sites using:
			<ul>
				<li>  Vanilla HTML, CSS3 and Javascript</li>
				<li>  Front-End frameworks such as Bootstrap and Materialize</li>
				<li>  JQuery, AngularJS, CSS3 animations</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>I am excited and hungry to learn as much as I can and push my career as far as I can while maintaining a work/life balance.</p>
		<p>While I am currently committed to a contract at the moment I would love to hear from you if there are opportunities that I may be a good fit for!</p>

		<h1>Web Development Immersive Student</h1>
		<h2>March 2015 â€“ June 2015</h2>
		<h3>Greater Seattle Area</h3>
		<p>General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) program was an all eggs in one basket, dive in head first type of environment. In order to attend I quit my job and completely dedicated myself to it. Each day (Monday through Saturday and usually Sunday) was filled (10-12 hours a day) with learning and implementing modern Web Development concepts and languages. During that time I created three WebApps, one in vanilla JS, on in Rails and one using Sails as well as a simple browser video game (a work in progress!).</p>
		<p>I learned so much about coding in those 12 weeks but the most important skill I developed was the skill to learn quickly. I am very comfortable being faced with a challenge I've never considered before and I am confident that I can, in a reasonable amount of time, identify a potential solution for the problem or realize it's time to pivot.</p>
		<p>The entire experience was amazing and I am extremely excited to begin developing my career!</p>
