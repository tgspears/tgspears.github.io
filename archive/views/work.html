      <h1>DAYSIE CHAIN</h1>

      <p>
        Daysie Chain allows you to quickly and easily organize your social life. You can create groups for specific events such as Saturday football games, D &amp; D nights with the crew, or the monthly Ladies' Night or Chinese takeout night with the guys. Add potential attendees to the group using their phone number and click send! Our service sends out a text to group members and allows them to RSVP through text. You can then track attendance and send reminders to those that haven't responded. No more difficult-to-manage group texts or confusion about time or date.
        <br />
        <br />
        Created in one week with two team members using Ruby on Rails, D3, Cloudinary, Bootstrap and Twilio with Facebook OAuth integration.
